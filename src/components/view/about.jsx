          Sometimes regular voter doesn't know about their current MLA/MP's past
          and their educational background. And what make it worse is voter can
          not even give their thoughts about candidate's work in their area on
          any online forum. Votechain tackle this problem by providing
          information about candidate to voters. Votechain give user to ability
          to review candidate's work in their area.
